# DataStructures1

# Please do not plaigirise this work - it taken me a long time to work on this, please use it as a guide or for inspiration :) 

This is the final version of the coursework I created for data structures and algorithms 1.

The PDF contains the slides that were used as part of the presentation, on this you can see the problem I chosen and what algorithms I decided to use to tackle this issue.

The project itself uses the boyer-moore and rabin-karp algorithms to search a 'breached database' for a given username and password, which will search for the term and return a statement to say that the username and password had not been found or had been found and that the user should update their current usernames and passwords.

The names file has been included, however the password file uses the rockyou.txt wordlist, but any wordlist will work, as long as you change the name of the file in the code :)
