# DataStructures1
This is the final version of the coursework I created for data structures and algorithms 1.

The PDF contains the slides that were used as part of the presentation, on this you can see the problem I chosen and what algorithms I decided to use to tackle this issue.

The project itself uses the boyer-moore and rabin-karp algorithms to search a 'breached database' for a given username and password, which will search for the term and return a statement to say that the username and password had not been found or had been found and that the user should update their current usernames and passwords.
